//! Entity-certified board authority read by Account verification.
//!
//! The authority is resolved straight from the Entity-committed
//! `certified_board_state`, the same tree the checkpoint graph is projected
//! from. Nothing is copied into the live replica, so a `BoardActivated`
//! committed by frame N is visible to frame N+1 inside the same process,
//! exactly like the TypeScript `resolveObserverCertifiedBoardRecord`.
//! Account input bytes never select or supply a board, and a missing exact
//! record means the peer is a lazy Entity rather than an implicit
//! compatibility fallback.
